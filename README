A minimal, yet functional frontpage in PHP

This project is basically a hobby project. Yet placed it on GitHub to show people how you can use MongoDB, PHP and AJAX together.

A preview of how it looks at the moment: http://i.imgur.com/DeIc7.png

# Features

*   **Fully AJAX**. Tab-switching, option-toggling and widget refreshing has AJAX support, so no unneeded full-page refreshing.
*   **One grid of favorites tabs per tab**. An unlimited number of tabs can be added and each tab has it's own grid. Each cell in the grid has a button (hidable) to either edit or delete the cell. 
*   **Settings**. The grid can enlarged or reduced in size at the settings page.
*   **Google**. Basic Google search bar available.
*   **Widgets**. A handy widgets bar at the right of the screen with the latest new, strips and feeds. A new widget can be added fast. Each stylesheet, JavaScript and PHP file of each widget has its widget "project" folder, so a great spatial organisation.
